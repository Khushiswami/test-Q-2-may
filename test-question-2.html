	 <h2>Question no-2</h2>
    <h3 style="color: red; font-family: cursive;"> What is the difference between null , undefined and not defined.
</h3>
    <h2>ANS</h2>
    <p><span class="span">Undefined :-</span> </br>1. Declared but not defined –
		JavaScript assigns ‘undefined’ to any object that has been declared but not initialized or defined. In other words, in a case where no value has been explicitly assigned to the variable, JavaScript calls it ‘undefined’.</br>2. Array index or object property that does not exist.</br>3. A function parameter that has not been supplied.</br>4. The return value of functions that have to but don’t return a value.


    <p><span class="span">Null :-</span></br>null is a reserved keyword in javascript. We can assign a null value to a variable explicitly using the keyword null. Null essentially represents a non-existent or an empty value i.e. we explicitly tell javascript interpreter that the variable has no value.</p>

    <p><span class="span">Not defined:-</span></br>A not defined is a variable which is not declared at a given point of time with declaration keyword like var, let or const.</p>
